## Slide 1
### Introduction
1. Project title: Los Angeles Accident Analysis and Highway Safety
2. Group: datum 
3. Team names: Wei-Chung Wang (weichunw), Roulei Xia(zhan634), Lu Zhung(rouleixi)

## Slide 2
### Simpson the newbie driver
1. A big city like LA works like an giant organism.
2. simpson is new driver who just earned his license.


<a name="slide3"></a>
## Slide 3
### But as a new driver... 
1. Passing the test is the start of more diffcult challenges.
2. Simpson was scared to death on the highway.
3. Thanks to Dr. Frink who came to rescue.

## Slide 4
### How to seelct a easy mode
1. Dr. Frink suggest newbie drivers should to the research.
2. Knows where are the most dangerous highway intersections and take a detour is always a good way to avoid 
potential dangers.

<a name="slide5"></a>
## Slide 5
### Danger Area Map
1. We introduce the solution, danger area map.
2. Danger area map show dangers section with large red dot.
3. Hovering on those dots will shows section name and actual collision count in the past year.

<a name="slide6"></a>
## Slide 6
### Interactive Visual
1. with zoom option we could zoom in/out the map
2. with map type option we have choice between terrain map and road map.
3. With filter on danger area map, Simpson knew where should he take a detour.

<a name="slide7"></a>
## Slide 7
### Dangerous time
1. Besides dangerous area, avoid to drive at dangerous time slot is crucial too.
2. Just when Simpson felt frustratd, Dr. Frink came up another solution.


<a name="slide8"></a>
## Slide 8
### Daily Risk visualization
1. What is the risk of being hit when we're traveling on the freeway?
2. We visualize freeway collision rate according to hours within a day.
3. Our line chart shows most dangerous freeway  from top to bottom.
4. On each freeway we shows most dangerous hours within a day.
5. To accurately compare between freeway we implement vertical line and figures when user hovering on hours.
6. Clicking on labels can filter out freeway which help people focus on few freeway they concern.

## Slide 9
### Ratio of Dangers
1. Besides from collision, what are other dangers we should be aware.
2. We shows hierarchy of dangers with a packed bubble chart.
3. We shows ratio of dangers using a pie chart 


<a name="slide10"></a>
## Slide 10
### Ratio of Dangers Visaulizaiton
1. Interaction of hierarchical bubble chart and pie chart.
2. Dynamically provide user ratio of dangers  at each level of danger hierarchy.


<a name="slide11"></a>
## Slide 11
### value of project
1. Traffic Safety is always a highly concerned Topic in Los Angeles.
2. Strong interaction and filtering options help users with different need.
3. This web-app provide interactive visualization comparing inter/intra freeways.
4. With help of our Web App people could make better decisions while traveling within LA.

## Slide 12
### Data Source 
1. We've access to USC Viterbi InfoLab.
2. This dataset is host within their server as postgres.
3. This dataset is recorded and reported by California Highway Portal.
4. We have done
